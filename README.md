# KittyCatApp

Test task for application to MacPaw Internship 2020

This app developed without third-party libraries and contains such functionality: 

1. List of breeds with detail info in separate screen
2. Quiz "Guess breed by photo"
3. Image gallery with cats

For architecture I used VIP-cycle.

Also I implemented small improvements such as:

1. Empty state in case error during API request
2. Image caching
3. Pagination for gallery
